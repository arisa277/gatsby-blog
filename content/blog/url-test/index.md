The following example is pulled from [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress). Downloaded files are created as `File` nodes and then linked to the WordPress Media node, so it can be queried both as a regular `File` node and from the `localFile` field in the Media node.
